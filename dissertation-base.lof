This error was caused by a fissure along the shared boundary which result in a unification error. This is because an early version of our algorithm assumed that voids would only occur in singular instances. The fissure made the logic believe we rejoined a shared boundary shape, causing most of the boundary to be lost in the unification process, depicted by the straight red line moving off the right size of the canvas which then meets up to complete a loop (see Figure \ref {fig:t-junction} to see an example of how the boundary loops).
