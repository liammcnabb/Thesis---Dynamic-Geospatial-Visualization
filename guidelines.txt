Converting a set of publications to a thesis.

In the Introduction Chapter of your thesis:

- Add an Abstract (an abstract of chapter abstracts)

- Add an introduction chapter -included abstracts from 
papers at end of introduction (10 pages or more.)

- Include a list of publications at the beginning of thesis 
on its own page

Body Content
- Modify each chapter title to form a more coherent story
(more than just a list of papers)

- Describe in 1-2 paragraphs how each chapter fits into the
overall thesis at the beginning of each chapter.

- Change all paper references to chapter references in text

- Cite the publication(s) that each chapter is based on at 
beginning of each chapter.

- Expand each chapter. Include content such as figures and text
that was removed due to space limitations.  Enlarge each
figure especially if it was shrunk to fit publication page
limits.  Also, re-integrate any appendix material from a
paper into the main text of the chapter.

- Include optional figures.

- (At least) remove the related work sub-section headers,
from each chapter. These can also be called "Background".

- The related work section of each paper can be moved to 
the literature review chapter.

- Add quotes to the start of each chapter

Ending Content
- Add a software engineering chapter -discuss details of implementation
that don't have room in publications.

-  Add a conclusion and future work chapter -an expanded version of 
all paper conclusions and future work (remove from individual chapters)

- The conclusions and future work chapter is at least 5-10 pages.  What
would the next PhD student do?

-  Add an Acknowledgements Section

-  Consider adding an Index.  Bobâ€™s thesis has a nice
index.
